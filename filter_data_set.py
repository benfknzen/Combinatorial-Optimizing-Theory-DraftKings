# Function
#
# Manipulates data specific to our application. A more complex Pandas library.
#
# Within this function there will be a Smart_filter which is a weighted approach towards finding optimal solutions while
# taking n-dimensional data. A neural network approach would be worth pursuing.
#
# *From Probability based elimination: When filtering on probability based elimination it is important to focus
# gathering and using data relative to the rules of the game.  Then creating a strong data organizer and
# optimizer based off of this
# raw data, rather than secondary or n-th order data.
